# weather-app

MISSION: 'You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.'  

## Motivation

In this project, we make our first web application with HTML, CSS and JS. We apply everything we learned so far. The goal here is to learn how to work with an API. We collect data from the API and print it on our page. 

## Details

This weather app shows the weather for the next 5 days. You can input the city you want. It also shows a line chart using chart.js?

## Tech/Framework used

Made with Visual Studio Code  
SASS & Vanilla Javascript  
API: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
Chart: [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
